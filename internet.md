# How internet work?

## history

- before computer filled with entire rooms
- 1962 j.c.r licklider - propose idea of a network of computer
- ARPANET 1969
  first message send from one computer to another
  (only 2 letter uscla->stanford)
- 1971 different location could connect each other(not many)
- 1971 Ray Tomlison made email in APRANET (electric mail) @
- 1971 Vinton cerf invented a way to introduce computers across the globe
  transmisiion control protocol TCP -> IP(internet protocol)

- 1980s cere's protocol

- 1991 Tim berners-lee
  world wide web webserver /html-http protocol /web client
  make public domain
  CERN

_this wasn't just data sharing space for scientists anymore
this was an entire network of information that was accessible to anyone with an
internet connection_

- 1992 browser Erwise
- 1993 mosaic created -web surfing
- 1994 netscape

## wires, cables & wifi

- internet ship binary info
- info made by bits (0-off,1-on)
- 8 bits ->1 byte -> 1024 bytes -> 1 kilo byte -> 1024 kilo byte ->1 mega byte
- ex) 1 song 2-4 mega bytes
- Today we physically send bits by electricity, light and radio waves
- example by light send 1 bit for second
- across ocean by light (wire)
- wireless //short range

## IP Address & DNS

- laptop -> wifi -> isp(internet service provider-> around word
- internet is expressed in a set of protocol / design
- protocol: a well known set of rules and standards used to communicate between machines
- address : unique to each device
- internet protocol /IP
- ex) 174.120.14.120 -> go to bits IPv4
  traditional address was 8 bits for each part
  so 32 bits
  country/ network - region/network - subnetwork -device

4billion unique

- is was not enough / IPv6 128bits/340 undecillion unique address

- Domain Name System <DNS>
  -> have IP address

- DNS servers are connected in a distributed hierarchy
  ex ) .org , .net ...

- DNS snooping?

## packets, routing, reliability

## HTTP & HTML

- web browser - URL

browser `get` request and server give back
image and vedio have own URL

`post` like email/password //with cookie

- secure sockets layer / transport layer security
- digital certificate

## how search works

- search engine are constantly scanning the web in advance
  to give answer more faster

- spider working with hyper link (crawling)

- search index each word -> too many result-> determine best answer

- ranking algorithm
  title, keyword

- google
  how many other webpages linked to a given page - page rank
- machine learning
